Wishop (Previous version of Jow ðŸ›’)
=========================================================

This is the code for the first MVP of Wishop/Jow, Developped in Swift 3.0 with a backend in PHP, only IOS Version you can contact me for the backend code. We created a backend API linked to Amazon Prime Now APIs to create a Database of products. 
The Concept of the application is that it recommends a Menu for the week then automatically transforms it into a shopping Basket. 

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS VERSION IS OUT OF DATE AND A LOT OF CHANGES AND UPDATES MUST BE MADE FOR IT TO WORK, BUT IT CAN HELP INSPIRE PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE SIMILAR PROJECTS
